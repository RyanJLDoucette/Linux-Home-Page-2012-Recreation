# Linux Home Page 2012 Recreation
  This is a webpage recreation of the Linux homepage of December 2012 found at: "https://web.archive.org/web/20121231211018/http://www.linux.org/".


  <b>I never intended to complete it.</b> This was just done to cut the rust off of my HTML/CSS as I intend to acquire the skills to work in web development. Major things to do better for next time is 
  1) <b>Better Naming Conventions</b> - The name of my divs do not make any sense and is very difficult to read since they do not adhere to any particular standard.
  2) <b>Make the page scalable for different size browsers</b> - Adjusting the size of the browswer ruins the layout of the page
